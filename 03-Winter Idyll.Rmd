# Winter Idyll

My feet kept on sinking through the winter crust,
And my footsteps kept on
filling up
[with warm, winter blood.]

My eyes on the horizon, a hand that sallies and knows
The puce of the flesh and the rose
on a blossom bank in the springtime,

And my hand was the wind a thousand miles away,
declaiming the verse in her hair:

There is more life in our short life,
than in all the wintry lives of the long-lived combined.

But my feet kept on sinking through the winter crust,
And my footsteps kept on
filling up
with warm, winter blood.

My footsteps were the winter's lips,
And my eyes watered and watched them fill with blood,
and hoped to see their Earthy speech.
