# Winter Idyll

My feet kept on sinking through the winter crust,
And my footsteps kept on
filling up
with warm, winter blood.

My eyes were the hand that sallies and knows
The puce of the flesh and the rose

My hands were the leaves, or tongues, of the trees
declaiming the verse in her hair

that although our lives are the shorter for the springtime,
there is more life in our short life,
than in the wintry lives of the long-lived combined.

Never before had I stopped to think
on all the idylls and gardens
of warm, winter blood to drink.

But my feet kept on sinking through the winter crust,
And my footsteps sputtered and gargled, as though to speak,
And my eyes watered and watched them fill with blood,
and hoped to see their Earthy speech.

[And as i walked away...My footsteps were the winter's lips.]
