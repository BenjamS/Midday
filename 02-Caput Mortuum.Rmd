# Caput Mortuum

Hallowed as icons in the candle glow
of triptych windows in suburban homes,
their fingers pinch the stirring sticks,
and the President looks up from the stirring pitch:

_"In the things that we buy, our souls are object'd_
_in fragments that tryst, but can't be connect'd."_

But the carpeted daises of suburban homes
do not remove us from the time or place
our sharded light gathered,
beneath the gazes of wives and apes of Christ,
in pillars of napalm that flickered and flamed,
as though dying to speak our names.

Hallowed as icons
in the candle glow,
the autumn light gathered on the carpeted daises of suburban homes,
in fragments that tryst but don't fit together,

_"In the things that we buy, our sharded light gathers..."_

docile as offramps beneath the morning commute,
beneath the gazes of wives, also mute.
