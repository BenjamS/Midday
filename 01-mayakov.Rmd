# Mayakovsky {#intro}

Mayakovsky returned the rose
window of Sun
to its perch in the cathedral-sky,
and raised his voice to the top of his spine,  
in a brimming toast to the end of the age.  

But the crippled milieu had not done
with the black bread of facile rhyme,  
and sent up an infinite, disconsolate moo,  
instead of the sunlight, to fill the sky;
[and returned their brow to the back of the pew.]

"Down with long walks on the tarmac,
at the hour of liftoff!" a chorus of Octobrist posters
hoarsely coughed
as it peeled from the walls of May.

And since that day, there've been many a Pskov king,  
and many a bread line on the Kuznetsky.  
and many who prefer a scathing weight,  
to the helium feet of the apogee.

Be not Lord, but Gagarin,
of what you survey, the cosmonaut's gazing declaimed,
And history was a church again.

from the bosom of the rocket blast.
chapel made of wilson cloud
a starless ordeal
